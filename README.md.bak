A fairly important patch for BetterCrew (either **[Full](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3031599475)** or [diet](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2892655130) version) to properly support modded races' techstations (S.A.I.L).

# The game won't start if you don't have [b]one[/b] of the two versions of Better Crew installed
**Don't install both the full and diet versions of better crew at once**

Supports a shipload of races, patches 300+ techstations... and I don't really feel like listing about 300+ mods in the description just yet.


Next step would be to make a patch to add crew anchors to modded tech stations and some decorations... but like, I can try to patch stuff as much as I can that there is just too many mods out there for me to patch everything.
If some modders can start adding support themselves, that would be swell °^°
